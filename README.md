# BirdBook

BirdBook is a lightweight social networking application inspired by platforms like Twitter/X. It implements core social features such as registration, login, posting, commenting, and dynamic user profiles, while maintaining clean authentication and session management.  

This project was built to demonstrate **full-stack development skills** using modern web technologies. It covers frontend design, backend logic, authentication, and database integration, making it a strong portfolio piece.

---

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js (React framework)**  
  Provides file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and dynamic routing. Profile pages are implemented with `[id].tsx` routes, making user profiles dynamic and scalable.
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI**  
  Utility-first CSS classes with DaisyUI components for fast, consistent, and customizable UI development.
- **TypeScript**  
  Adds static typing for safer, more maintainable code and smoother developer experience.
- **Axios**  
  Handles API requests between the frontend and backend in a clean, promise-based way, simplifying data fetching and error handling.

### **Backend**
- **Next.js API Routes**  
  Handles backend logic directly within the app (`/pages/api/...`), keeping frontend and backend integrated.
- **Node.js**  
  Provides the runtime environment for executing server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **Bcrypt**  
  Ensures secure password storage with hashing.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**  
  Used for authentication and session management. Tokens are issued upon login/registration and are validated with each protected request.

### **Database**
- **PostgreSQL**  
  Stores users, posts, comments, and profile data.  
- **Prisma ORM**  
  Simplifies database interactions with a type-safe schema and query builder.

### **Authentication**
- **JWT-based Authentication**  
  On login, the backend generates a signed JWT containing user session details.  
  - Stored securely in HTTP-only cookies (or headers, depending on config).  
  - Middleware validates JWTs for protected routes.  
- **Axios + JWTs**  
  Frontend requests include JWTs for authenticated API calls (posting, commenting, profile updates).

## Roadmap

Planned improvements and next steps:

- "Load More" buttons for posts and comments  
- Infinite scrolling for the feed  
- Responsive design improvements  
- Uploading custom profile pictures  
- Like/reaction system  
- Deployment on cloud platforms (Vercel, AWS, etc.)  
- Pagination and caching strategies for posts  
- Rate limiting on posts/comments  
- Better error handling and logging

## Deployment Options

### **1. AWS Deployment**
BirdBook can be deployed using **AWS managed services** for scalability and reliability:  
- **Frontend/Backend (Next.js)** → Deploy on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or containerize with **Amazon ECS/Fargate**.  
- **Database** → Use **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** for managed database hosting.  
- **Authentication Secrets** → Store JWT secrets and database credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store**.  
- **Storage** → Use **Amazon S3** for static assets (e.g., profile pictures).  
- **Load Balancing** → **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic.  
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions → Deploy to AWS via **CodePipeline** or **Amplify**.  

---

### **2. Kubernetes Deployment**
BirdBook can also be deployed with **Kubernetes** for greater flexibility:  
- **Containerization** → Build Docker images for the Next.js app and run them as **Kubernetes Deployments**.  
- **Service Management** → Expose APIs and frontend with **Kubernetes Services** and optionally an **Ingress Controller (NGINX)**.  
- **Database** → Use a managed **PostgreSQL** (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) or run PostgreSQL as a **StatefulSet** inside the cluster.  
- **Secrets** → Store JWT secrets and DB credentials as **Kubernetes Secrets**.  
- **Scaling** → Enable **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to handle traffic spikes.  
- **CI/CD** → Automate deployments with **ArgoCD** or **Flux** connected to GitHub.

JWT_SECRET=your_secret
```

### 4. Set Up the Database
Run Prisma migrations to create the database schema:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

*(Optional)* If you have a seed file for test data:
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### 5. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
